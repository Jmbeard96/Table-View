        Heroes(name: "Captain America", imageName: "captainAmerica", gender: "Male", height: 72, weight: 220, bio: "Captain America represented the pinnacle of human physical perfection. He experienced a time when he was augmented to superhuman levels, but generally performed just below superhuman levels for most of his career. Captain America had a very high intelligence as well as agility, strength, speed, endurance, and reaction time superior to any Olympic athlete who ever competed. The Super-Soldier formula that he had metabolized had enhanced all of his bodily functions to the peak of human efficiency. Most notably, his body eliminates the excessive build-up of fatigue-producing poisons in his muscles, granting him phenomenal endurance."),
        
        Heroes(name: "Iron Man", imageName: "ironMan", gender: "Male", height: 78, weight: 425, bio: "Tony has a genius level intellect that allows him to invent a wide range of sophisticated devices, specializing in advanced weapons and armor. He possesses a keen business mind."),
        
        
        Heroes(name: "Ant Man", imageName: "antman", gender: "Male", height: 72, weight: 190, bio: "Has the ability to shrink to roughly the size of an ant, also can communicate telepathically with insects, and (as Ant-Man) can punch with as much force as a normal sized person"),
        
        Heroes(name: "Black Panther", imageName: "blackPanther", gender: "Male", height: 72, weight: 200, bio: "T'Challa is a brilliant tactician, strategist, scientist, tracker and a master of all forms of unarmed combat whose unique hybrid fighting style incorporates acrobatics and aspects of animal mimicry. T'Challa being a royal descendent of a warrior race is also a master of armed combat, able to use a variety of weapons but prefers unarmed combat. He is a master planner who always thinks several steps ahead and will go to extreme measures to achieve his goals and protect the kingdom of Wakanda."),
        
        Heroes(name: "Thor", imageName: "thor", gender: "Male", height: 78, weight: 640, bio: "As the son of Odin and Gaea, Thor's strength, endurance and resistance to injury are greater than the vast majority of his superhuman race. He is extremely long-lived (though not completely immune to aging), immune to conventional disease and highly resistant to injury. His flesh and bones are several times denser than a human's. As Lord of Asgard, Thor possessed the Odinforce, which enabled him to tap into the near-infinite resources of cosmic and mystical energies, enhancing all of his abilities. With the vast magical power of the Odinforce, Thor was even able to dent Captain America’s virtually indestructible shield with Mjolnir."),
        
        Heroes(name: "Superman", imageName: "superman", gender: "Male", height: 75, weight: 235, bio: "He's Superman. Deal with it."),
        
        Heroes(name: "The Flash", imageName: "flash", gender: "Male", height: 72, weight: 220, bio: "Able to run at near light-speeds, his powers provide the ultimate caffeine kick: He can run up buildings, move so swiftly he phases through objects, create sonic booms with the snap of his fingers—and never need to order delivery. Despite his speed, Barry can become so obsessed with crime-solving he can still lose track of everything else around him, leaving the fastest man alive constantly running a minute behind."),
        
        Heroes(name: "Black Widow", imageName: "blackWidow", gender: "Female", height: 67, weight: 135, bio: "Black Widow customarily wears two bracelets equipped to discharge the \"widow’s bite,\" high-frequency electrostatic bolts of up to 30,000 volts, capable of stunning even a superhuman opponent at a range of at least 20 feet, shoot tear gas cartridges and act as a radio transmitter. The bracelets’ various functions are activated by galvanic sensors keyed to Black Widow’s wrist musculature. At times she carries plastic explosive discs equivalent to 4 pounds of TNT in her belt and uses automatic weapons and/or combat knives as necessary."),
        
        Heroes(name: "The Incredible Hulk", imageName: "hulk", gender: "Male", height: 96, weight: 1400, bio: "The Hulk is super strong, nearly invincible, and super angry."),
        
        Heroes(name: "Doctor Strange", imageName: "doctorStrange", gender: "Male", height: 74, weight: 180, bio: "Doctor Strange is one of the most powerful sorcerers in existence. Like most sorcerers, he draws his power from three primary sources: the invocation of powerful mystic entities or objects, the manipulation of the universe's ambient magical energy, and his own psychic resources. Strange's magical repertoire includes energy projection and manipulation, matter transformation, animation of inanimate objects, teleportation, illusion-casting, mesmerism, thought projection, astral projection, dimensional travel, time travel and mental possession, to name a few. The full range of his abilities is unknown. Doctor Strange's powers are sometimes less effective against strictly science-based opponents, although he can overcome this limitation with effort."),
        
        Heroes(name: "Spiderman", imageName: "spiderman", gender: "Male", height: 70, weight: 180, bio: "Peter can cling to most surfaces, has superhuman strength (able to lift 10 tons optimally) and is roughly 15 times more agile than a regular human. The combination of his acrobatic leaps and web-slinging enables him to travel rapidly from place to place. His spider-sense provides an early warning detection system linked with his superhuman kinesthetics, enabling him the ability to evade most any injury, provided he doesn't cognitively override the autonomic reflexes. Note: his power enhancements through his transformation by the Queen and after battling Morlun - including his organic web glands and stingers - have been undone after Spider-Man's deal with Mephisto."),
        
        Heroes(name: "Vision", imageName: "vision", gender: "Male", height: 75, weight: 300, bio: "The Vision possesses complete control over his density, and so is able to render himself intangible or extraordinarily massive and diamond-hard at will. He can partially materialize within another person, causing his victim extreme pain. The solar cell on the Vision's forehead emits beams of infrared and microwave radiation, with temperatures ranging from 500 to 30,000 degrees Fahrenheit.")
